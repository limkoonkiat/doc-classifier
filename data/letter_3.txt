Subject: Internal Review - New Medical Withdrawal Guidelines

Hi Sarah,

Could you review the draft guidelines for the new medical withdrawal process? I've incorporated the feedback from last week's meeting regarding the income ceiling adjustments.

The key changes are:

Updated income ceiling from $14,000 to $14,500
Revised documentation requirements for self-employed applicants
New section on appeals process
Please let me know your thoughts by Friday.

Regards,
Ahmad
